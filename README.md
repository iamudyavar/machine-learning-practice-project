# Machine Learning Project

In this project, I will predict the aqueous solubility of a molecule (how easily the molecule dissolves in water) based on its molecular descriptors, including the logarithm of the partition coefficient (MolLogP), molecular weight (MolWt), number of rotatable bonds (NumRotatableBonds), proportion of aromatic atoms (AromaticProportion), and other relevant features.
